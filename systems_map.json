        "description": "Represents the realistic pluralism of early Buddhism. Reality is analyzed into ultimate distinct constituents called 'dharmas' (momentary events of consciousness and matter) which arise and perish causally. It rejects the Mahayana notion of emptiness as an ontological ground, focusing instead on the phenomenological reality of these transient events.",

It teaches that the Supreme Reality (Brahman/Vishnu) is a Personal God who possesses the souls and the material world as His 'body'. While God is the only independent reality, the world and souls are real, distinct attributes that exist in an organic, inseparable unity with Him. It emphasizes Bhakti (loving devotion) as the means to liberation.",
