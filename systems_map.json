Reality is analyzed into ultimate distinct constituents called 'dharmas' (momentary events of consciousness and matter) which arise and perish causally. It rejects the Mahayana notion of emptiness as an ontological ground, focusing instead on the phenomenological reality of these transient events.",

God is radically transcendent, having withdrawn from creation (kenosis). The ego is an illusion to be 'decreated' so the soul can receive grace. Beauty and affliction (malheur) are the two privileged contact points with the divine. Salvation comes through attention, renunciation, and loving consent to necessity.",
