# What is Your Metaphysics?

Discover your philosophical worldview in 8 dimensions.

This interactive quiz maps your beliefs across fundamental metaphysical questions—from the nature of reality to the existence of the divine—and matches you with the historical system that best fits your views.

## Features

-   **8 Fundamental Dimensions**: Explore your stance on Ontology, Topology, Dynamics, Teleology, Manifestation, Divinity, Character, and Axiology.
-   **System Matching**: Compare your profile against 17 major philosophical systems, including Stoicism, Spinozism, Advaita Vedanta, Scientific Materialism, and more.
-   **Detailed Breakdown**: See exactly where you align and diverge with your top match and runner-up.
-   **Runner-Up Feature**: View your second-best match to see alternative perspectives that are close to your own.
-   **Explore Page**: Browse all systems with detailed breakdowns, including primary source recommendations and Wikipedia links.
-   **Compare Page**: Select any two systems to see a side-by-side comparison of their dimensional values.
-   **Map Visualization**: View a 2D projection of the metaphysical landscape to see how systems cluster together.
-   **Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark themes for comfortable viewing.
-   **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices.

## How to Run

Because this application loads data from JSON files, you need to run it through a local web server to avoid browser security restrictions (CORS).

### Using Python (Recommended)
If you have Python installed, you can run a simple server from the project directory:

```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server

# Python 2
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Then open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser.

### Using Node.js
If you have Node.js installed, you can use `http-server`:

```bash
npx http-server .
```

Then open the URL shown in the terminal (usually [http://127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080)).

## Regenerating the Map

The `map.html` page uses coordinates generated by a Python script. If you modify `systems.json` or want to experiment with different dimensionality reduction algorithms (MDS or t-SNE), you can regenerate the map data.

### Dependencies
You will need Python installed with the following packages:
-   `scikit-learn`
-   `numpy`

```bash
pip install scikit-learn numpy
```

### Usage
Run the script from the root directory:

```bash
python generate_map.py
```

By default, it uses MDS (Multidimensional Scaling). You can specify t-SNE with an argument:

```bash
python generate_map.py --algorithm tsne
```

This will update `systems_map.json`, which is read by `map.html`.

## Technologies Used

-   **HTML5**: Semantic structure.
-   **CSS3**: Custom styling with CSS variables for theming.
-   **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)**: Logic for the quiz, scoring, and UI updates.
-   **Google Fonts**: Typography (Outfit and Playfair Display).
-   **D3.js** (implied): Used for the map visualization (if applicable, or custom JS).
